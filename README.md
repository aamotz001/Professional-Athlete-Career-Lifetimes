## Final Project Repo

### Triangle Roles: Shihab & Peter 
* Responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. 

* Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. This grants more time to work out the specifics related to machine learning.

* Keep the following questions in mind as the machine learning model is developed:
  * Which model did you choose and why? 
    * Neural Network
  * How are you training your model?
  * What is the model's accuracy?
  * How does this model work?

* The first segment is all about preparation, so a simple model will cover the first question
  * The type of machine learning model chosen and why. 
  * Create a simple model that isn't concerned with accuracy.
  * Want the model to take input data and return a label and that's it!
