# Professional-Athlete-Career-Lifetimes
## Final Project Repo

### Triangle Roles: Shihab & Peter 

* Keep the following questions in mind as the machine learning model is developed:
  * Which model did you choose and why? 
    * Our group will be implementing the neural network learning model in order to predict athletes career longevity from the NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB. 
    * There will be two different types of neural network models. The independent variable for the first model will be when the player first started in the league. The second model will be when the player retired from the specific year. The y-value for both models will be the years played.

  * How are you training your model?
    * We will train the neural network learning model by using 75/25 proportion of the learning/testing data. If the global accuracy of the neural network model is poor, we will use the 20/80 proportion of the learning/testing data.
  
  * What is the model's accuracy?
    * Our goal for this project to achieve a 60% accuracy on our neural network model.
  
  * How does this model work?
    * Pseudocode
